The United Nations has a much more complex structure than people realize. It is partially delegates at the headquarters in New York giving world-renowned speeches but more often than not, it is a web of committees that accomplish most of the work. I don’t admit this very often because it is a little embarrassing, but I was President of Model UN in high school. I am also a GIS student. Because of this, I’ve become pretty familiar with the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted in 2015, these goals provide a roadmap for global progress by 2030. In their research, Matilda E. Dunn, Yizhong Huan, and Caroline Howe analyzed the UN’s network and its progress toward these goals, concluding that the pace of progress is too slow. Through a detailed analysis of the intricate network, they highlighted significant delays.In my analysis, I aim to investigate which entities play a central role in the delivery of the UN’s biodiversity initiatives. The primary stakeholder in this analysis is the UN itself, as this research can help them identify where to concentrate their efforts to drive more effective action
